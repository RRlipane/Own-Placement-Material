        ------------IMP Notes ---------------

        C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an enhancement of the C language to include an object-oriented paradigm. It is an imperative and compiled language. C++ has a number of features, including:

        Object-Oriented Programming
        Machine Independent
        Simple
        High-Level Language
        Popular
        Case-sensitive
        Compiler Based
        Dynamic Memory Allocation
        Memory Management
        Multi-threading

        - First name of c++ was c with classes
        - using namespace std is a bad practice because of defined all the library in a globally in outsite so there may be a collision


   

   //Dynamic memory allocation using a new and delete operator
   int num=5;
   int* ptr=new int[num];
   //dynamic alloction is need to be deleted it is not automatically deleted  so we used delete opertor 
   delete ptr;
   

   //we can used macros in our function
   for(int i=0;i<min;i++){
        cout<<i<<endl;
   }

    //variable 
    int a=5;
    types- Local,gobal,static

    //const keyword
